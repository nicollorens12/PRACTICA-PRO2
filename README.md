## Container Organizer in C++

This is the final assignment of UPC's PRO2 (Programming 2) course at FIB.

This was my very first project in C++ (and in programming!). So there are many non-optimized algorithms and data structures.

This project is about algorithm and data structures, so it's only the backend. Can only interactuate with the application through shell.
